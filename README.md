## Grant themes of interest to the Arweave Core Team
_Excerpt from the [Arweave.org site](https://www.arweave.org/get-involved/grants-funding)_

**Building Information Gold**
* Information is the new oil. As such, there is no better resource to back a currency with. Build apps and bots to help us fill the Arweave with permanent and verifiable records of all of humanity's valuable knowledge and history.

**Arweave for businesses**
* Permanent and verifiable storage opens immense avenues for value creation in the business world. From verifiable legal contract storage, to data archiving solutions that set a new standard for data integrity, we want to invest in and help companies that build on the Arweave protocol.

**An open source web** 
* Once permaweb services are launched, their developers never have to pay for hosting them again. Users of permaweb apps can have confidence that the service will not degrade or change under their feet. This fundamentally changes the game for web service development, allowing us to collectively build an open source web. Read more here.

**Preserving history**
* The Permaweb is designed to prevent the destruction of history. Once something is uploaded, it cannot be deleted, altered, or lost. Store valuable cultural and historical information on it to ensure that it remains available for future generations.
